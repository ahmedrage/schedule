## The University of Adelaide Lecture Schedule Extractor

This is a script I wrote several years ago while at university. It extracts all the lecture times from The University of Adelaide websites into a spreadsheet. It is a useful tool for clubs looking to make lecture announcements. It has not been maintained, and was written as a beginner project for Python.

### How to run script

1. Install requirements with ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Run ```python3 schedule_2.py```
3. The lectures will be loaded into a file lectures.xlsx

### If that doesn't work

Try using the virtual environment

1. Load the virtual environment with ```source env/bin/activate```
2. Run ```python3 schedule_2.py```
